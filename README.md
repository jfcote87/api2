# Google APIs Client Library for Go

This is a rewrite of google.golang.org/api that is attempting to be an in place replacement for the existing library while adding an ability to add batch capability and more flexible upload operations.
These are auto-generated Go libraries from the Google Discovery Service's JSON description files of the available "new style" Google APIs.

For docs, see e.g.:

   https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/api/storage/v1

The package of a given import is the second-to-last component, before the version number.
